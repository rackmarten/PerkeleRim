<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Uploads a file to VirusTotal (API v3), waits for its scan and writes the result as JSON:
    sha256, the report's url, status ("completed", "queued" when it took longer than -WaitMinutes,
    "skipped" without an API key) and the engines' stats (malicious, suspicious, undetected...).
    The API key comes from VT_API_KEY (a free VirusTotal account's key; the release workflow passes
    the repository secret of that name). VirusTotal shares what it's sent with the security
    community, so only send what's public anyway, such as a release zip.
    PowerShell 7 (Invoke-RestMethod -Form).
